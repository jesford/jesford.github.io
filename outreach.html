  <h2 class="hdr">Public Outreach & Education</h2>

  <p>Here I am posting activities and worksheets I have developed, in
  the hopes that others find this useful (photos and more details to
  come!).  These projects have been tackled in regular classrooms,
  during astronomy and physics summer camps, and at Science World in
  Vancouver, BC.</p>

  <p>Feel free to use and/or modify the materials! If you make any
  improvements that you found worthwhile, or have any requests or
  ideas for me, I would love to hear about it. If you are looking for
  a scientist to visit your classroom (in Seattle, WA or Vancouver,
  BC, or somewhere in between), please reach out and we can discuss. </p>

  <div id="activities"><h3 class="hdr">Activities:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Gravitational Lensing:</b> Here are two different activities
  that are complementary, and can be explored either individually or
    sequentially.
    <ol><li>Simulating gravitational lensing effects using the
  base of a wineglass to make arcs and multiple images. Here is the
  student <a href="materials/lensing_worksheet.pdf">activity worksheet</a>
  I have developed. Excellent resources on creating the lenses, the
  physical principles, and more activity ideas are in the
  <a href="materials/FalboKenkel96.pdf">original paper</a> on the wine glass
      demo, and more recently <a href="materials/HuweField15.pdf">here</a>. If
  there is time, I usually lead into the topic of lensing by talking
  about cosmology and dark matter, using a version of these <a href="materials/cosmology_slides.pdf">slides</a> (at
  the end are some classroom-wide "find the lens" challenges that we
      do after the hands-on wineglass investigations).</li>

      </div>
      <li>Using a large "gravity simulator" to observe particle
  trajectories, such as photons in a gravitational potential (and many
  other general relativity investigations are possible with this
  demo). See <a href="materials/FordStangAnderson15.pdf">our recent paper</a>
  describing how we built the simulator and led the
      activities. </li></ol></li>

      </div>
    <li><b>Cloud Chamber:</b> If you have ever seen a cloud chamber (a
    chamber containing some type of fog through which you can see
    tracks condensing and highlighting the paths of subatomic particles),
    you will never forget it! It's as close to actually seeing
    electrons, muons, alpha particles, gamma-rays, etc, as you will
    ever get. This
    hands-on experiment actually allows students to build their own
    tiny cloud chamber using nothing but items you can buy at a dollar
    store... plus some dry ice (which I usually obtain through the
    chemistry department at my university, and which is a safety
    hazard, so requires some extra precaution). Here are the <a
    href="materials/cloudchamber_slides.pdf">slides</a> I have used to introduce
    the activity, walk through set-up, and wrap up with some interesting
    astronomical phenomena. Depending on the level of the students
    (I've succesfully done this with middle school through high school
    students) I sometimes have them work through this <a
    href="materials/cloudchamber_worksheet.pdf">worksheet</a> and then we talk
    about measurement uncertainty and a little statistics. I found this <a
    href="http://popperfont.net/2013/01/28/making-cloud-chambers-for-elementary-school-kids-and-anyone-else-who-would-appreciate-epic-diy-science/">blog
    post</a> extremely useful when I was first getting started
      with this activity.</li>
      <div align="center">
	<img class="outreachphoto" src="./photos/cloudchamber.jpg"/>
      </div>
    <li><b>Galaxy Zoo:</b> While the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a> website
    contains dozens of engaging and really interesting citizen science projects to use in your
    classroom (as well as a lot of good teacher resources), I've
    tended to focus on <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy
    Zoo</a> for an in-class activity. Here are the <a
    href="materials/galaxyzoo_slides.pdf">slides</a> I use as an
    introduction (putting it in the context of cosmology, cause that's my thing), and then I
    have the students work through some galaxy classification in pairs
    (this obviously requires computer access). We usually wrap up by
    doing a some galaxy art (oil pastels on black paper work great -
    see the last slide in this presentation for an example)
    because galaxies are so beautiful and diverse. I have also given a
    more general <a href="materials/citizenscience_worksheet.pdf">citizen
    science homework assignment</a> where students
    choose one of the projects that interests then, and then
    present an overview of the scientific questions and method to
      their fellow students in class.</li>
      
    <li><b>Cosmology:</b> Here is an example of the <a
    href="materials/cosmology_slides.pdf">slides</a> that I use for
    talking about cosmology.  I really love showing the <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LBltePDZw">SDSS
    flythrough</a> of the universe (it's real data!), often following up with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKWUB_B-aA&feature=youtu.be">Millenium
    Simulation flythrough</a> (the other/dark stuff we can't see by
    eye!). Usually these presentations get tied into
    either the gravitational lensing activity or a general relativity activity.

    <li><b>Physics of Music:</b> <i>Why does the same note sound
    different when played on different instruments?</i> This
    activity requires some fairly
    specialized lab equipment, which my university at the time (UBC)
    had available for undergraduate physics labs. I had high school
    students bring in their instruments (their own voice was an option!)
    and we played into a microphone connected to some computer
    software that analyzed the Fourier Spectrum. It is really cool to
    see how the same note has very different overtones for different
    instruments and for the human voice singing different vowels. This
    is the <a href="materials/music_worksheet.pdf">worksheet</a> that we
      used.</li>
      
    <li><b>Extreme Sports Physics:</b> Because of my background as a
    competitive snowboarder, I've always been fascinated by
    understanding the complex physics that describes my trajectory
    through the air, and the role of angular momentum. Here are
    some <a href="materials/extremesports_slides.pdf">slides</a> I used when introducing the topic of
    free-fall to middle school and high school students. I built a bunch of "mystery center-of-mass
    rods", which were tubes containing a hidden (interior) weight at
    some arbitrary point. Students had to find and mark the center-of-mass with
    a piece of colored tape. Then they tossed it to a partner, flipping it
    randomly through the air, while I filmed it with a high-speed
    camera. This video was projected onto a whiteboard in slow-motion,
    where we traced out the path of the center-of-mass, visible by the colored tape. The center-of-mass follows a perfect
    parabola, and everything else rotates about that point, just
    like the more complicated (non-rigid) human body when hurtling
      through the air!</li>
      
    <li><b>Gravity:</b> See <a href="materials/FordStangAnderson15.pdf">our
    recent paper</a> on building and using a large gravity simulator.
    There are a ton of great activities that can be done with this
    set-up. I'll post more examples eventually, but you can find a ton
      of great ideas by searching the web. </li>
      
    <li><b>Thermodynamics and more:</b> hydraulics, bouyancy,
  pressure... I'll add descriptions of these activities as I find the
  time. Several year ago I ran an entire day full of activities related to <i>fluid
  dynamics</i> for a group of middle school students, the outline of which
  is <a href="materials/fluiddynamics_outline.pdf">here</a> (it's brief, but it
  might give you some ideas for activities, and I'm happy to answer
  any questions by email).</li>
