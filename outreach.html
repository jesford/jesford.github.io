  <h2 class="hdr">Public Outreach & Education</h2>

  <p>Here I am posting activities and worksheets I have developed, in
  the hopes that others find this useful (photos and more details to
  come!).  These projects have been tackled in regular classrooms,
  during astronomy and physics summer camps, and at Science World in
  Vancouver, BC.</p>

  <p>Feel free to use and/or modify the materials! If you make any
  improvements that you found worthwhile, or have any requests or
  ideas for me, I would love to hear about it. If you are looking for
  a scientist to visit your classroom (in Seattle, WA or Vancouver,
  BC, or somewhere in between), please reach out and we can discuss. </p>

  <p>Contact me at: jesford@uw.edu </p>

  
  <div id="activities"><h3 class="hdr">Activities:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Gravitational Lensing:</b> Here are two different activities
  that are complementary, and can be explored either individually or
    sequentially.
    <ol><li>Simulating gravitational lensing effects using the
  base of a wineglass to make arcs and multiple images. Here is the
  student <a href="lensing_worksheet.pdf">activity worksheet</a>
  I have used. Excellent resources on creating the lenses, the
  physical principles, and more activity ideas are in the
  <a href="FalboKenkel96.pdf">original paper</a> on the wine glass
      demo, and more recently <a href="HuweField15.pdf">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Using a large "gravity simulator" to observe particle
  trajectories, such as photons in a gravitational potential (and many
  other general relativity investigations are possible with this
  demo). See <a href="FordStangAnderson15.pdf">our recent paper</a>
  describing how we built the simulator and led the
      activities. </li></ol></li>
      
    <li><b>Cloud Chamber:</b> If you have ever seen a cloud chamber (a
    chamber containing some type of fog through which you can see
    tracks condensing and highlighting the paths of subatomic particles),
    you will never forget it! It's as close to actually seeing
    electrons, muons, alpha particles, gamma-rays, etc, as you will
    ever get. This
    hands-on experiment actually allows students to build their own
    tiny cloud chamber using nothing but items you can buy at a dollar
    store... plus some dry ice (which I usually obtain through the
    chemistry department at my university, and which is a safety
    hazard - so it requires some extra precautions). Here are the <a
    href="cloudchamber_slides.pdf">slides</a> I have used to introduce
    the activity, walk through set-up, and wrap up with some interesting
    astronomical phenomena. I found this <a
    href="http://popperfont.net/2013/01/28/making-cloud-chambers-for-elementary-school-kids-and-anyone-else-who-would-appreciate-epic-diy-science/">blog
    post</a> extremely useful when I was first getting started
    with this activity.</li>
    <li>Galaxy Zoo</li>
    <li>Cosmology</li>
    <li>Extreme Sports Physics</li>
    <li>Gravity</li>
    <li>Thermodynamics</li>
  </ul>
