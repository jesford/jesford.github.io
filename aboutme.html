  <h2 class="hdr">About Me</h2>

  <p>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the eScience Institute at the
  University of Washington, working to bridge the gap between my
  domain science - astronomy - and the tools of data science. My
  research spans from the very large (cosmology, the
  universe as a whole) to the small but deadly (detecting killer
  asteroids with <a href="http://lsst.org/">LSST</a>).</p>
  
  <p>I grew up in the small ski town of Girdwood, Alaska. Outdoor
  activities and especially snowsports were always a big part of my
  life. I spent several years following the snow to various spots around
  the Northwest, and loving life, as a sponsored competitive
  snowboarder. Fresh powder remains an important part of my work life
  balance today. </p>

  <p>I did my ungrad at the University of Nevada - Reno,
  while living and snowboarding up at Lake Tahoe, and completed my PhD
  at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, while enjoying
  Whistler and the north shore mountains. In Fall 2015 I finished my
  PhD and started my current postdoctoral position in Seattle.</p>

<p>I enjoy traveling and experiencing new places, and being generally
  active and outside as much as possible. In my spare time I enjoy all
  kinds of adventures, from hiking and skateboarding to surfing on Vancouver Island. On weekends during the winter you can find me at Stevens Pass, Whistler-Blackcomb, or exploring the BC
  backcountry on my splitboard.</p>

<p>I find teaching and outreach incredibly rewarding. Since joining
  the University of Washington, I have gotten involved with
  teaching <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software
  Carpentry</a>, a two day course on computing skills for
  scientists. I have also designed a number of classroom <a
  href="outreach.html">activities</a> based on dark matter and
  lensing, as well the physics of extreme sports, music, and other
  topics. When <a href="research.html">research</a> gets frustrating, I am reminded how amazing it
all is by talking to kids about space!</p>


<h3 id="sbsubsection">Before I Was An Astrophysicist...</h3>

<p>I spent my life in the mountains, pushing the limits of what I was physically and mentally capable of. I competed in almost every event from banked slalom and boardercross, to rail jams and slopestyle (my favorite). After leaving Alaska, I spent some time in Bozeman, Montana, followed by about 6 years in Lake Tahoe, California, where I honed my skills and picked up my first major sponsors. </p>

<p>When I did return to university to study Physics, I managed to continue snowboarding competitively throughout my undergraduate education, in addition to working a night job to support myself. The University of Nevada wrote an article on my unconventional yet successful path to my BSc degree. </p>

<p>During these years I learned a lot more than just how to snowboard really well. I learned how to work extremely hard at something I was passionate about. I learned how to really visualize a goal, and commit to make it a reality. I learned discipline and how to balance an extremely packed schedule. I learned how to win and lose with dignity. I also had a lot of fun, a lot of powder, and made a lot of great friends along the way. </p>
