  <h2 class="hdr">About Me</h2>

  <p>I grew up in the small ski town of Girdwood, Alaska. Outdoor
  activities and especially snowsports were always a big part of my
  life. I spent some years following the snow to various spots around
  the Northwest. I did my ungrad at the University of Nevada - Reno,
  while living and snowboarding up at Lake Tahoe, and completed my PhD
  at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I recently
  started a postdoc at the eScience Institute at the University of
  Washington in Seattle.</p>
  

<p>I enjoy traveling and experiencing new places, and being generally
  active and outside as much as possible. In the summer I like to
  hike, camp, skateboard, and surf. On weekends during the winter you
  can find me at Stevens Pass, Whistler-Blackcomb, or exploring the BC
  backcountry on my splitboard.</p>

<p>I find teaching and outreach incredibly rewarding. Since joining
  the University of Washington, I have been gotten involved with
  teaching <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software
  Carpentry</a>, a two day course on computing skills for
  scientists. I have also designed a number of classroom <a
  href="outreach.html">activities</a> based on dark matter and
  lensing, as well the physics of extreme sports, music, and other
  topics. When research gets frustrating, I am reminded how amazing it
  all is by talking to kids about space!</p>
